  <h3>Het Koradia</h3>
  <p>
    Whether it's tackling a team project, learning a new program, or taking my camera into unexplored places, I always love to embrace a good challenge and push myself to give my 110%.
    Such a mindset has not only proven to be an invaluable skill in the classroom but also in the real world.
    Having completed two internships at Capital One, I can say that my drive to learn and conquer has allowed me to stand out from the rest of the interns.
    I've learnt the fundamentals of computer science with programming languages like C++ and Python, and this has allowed me to tackle much more complex skills such as machine learning and computer vision, both of which I hope to one day pursue a career in.

    Apart from just my schooling, I've made multiple projects ranging from a variety of skill sets.
    My journey began with creating a simple platformer game with Java Spring Boot.
    Moving on, I learnt basic Android development and simple database design, deepening my understanding of what goes into software development.
    Soon after, I tried my hand at backend and cloud technologies while also implementing API calls from third-party websites to create beautiful frontend pages.
    Venturing into hardware integration, I constructed a DIY Security System; this Raspberry Pi-powered device uses Python and OpenCV to deliver real-time object detection and automates cloud backups via Google Drive API.
    Most recently, I led full-stack development for Connect Campus, a housing platform supporting 100+ TAMU students.
    Leveraging Docker, AWS EC2, and PostgreSQL, I built a secure, scalable solution with responsive Next.js user interfaces and robust JWT authentication.

    In my free time, I love exploring, whether that's mountain tops, caves, or even jaw-dropping cities.
    A recent hobby that I have picked up is photography (still trying to learn, so if you have any tips, I'd love to hear them).
    Apart from these, I also love cooking, and my favorite thing to make is egg fried rice.
